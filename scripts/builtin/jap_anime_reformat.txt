# Japanese Anime Card Reformatting Script
# This script reformats Japanese anime-related Anki cards to a standardized format.
# It performs the following operations:
# 1. Creates a new model with standardized fields and formatting
# 2. Migrates existing notes to the new model
# 3. Applies field population rules

# Create the new model using the built-in configuration
add-model --config jap_anime_reformat

# Migrate notes from the old model to the new one
# The field mapping will be loaded from the configuration
migrate-notes --model "Basic" --target-model "Japanese Anime Card" --config jap_anime_reformat
